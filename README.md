## Si4707 SAME Weather Radio ##

### Description ###
Weather-band radio is an awesome service on the 162.4 to 162.55MHz band in the US, Canada and Bermuda that broadcasts normal and emergency weather information. It’s a good way to get a weather report and a great way to stay informed during a severe weather emergency.

The Si4707 from Silicon Labs is a fully integrated weather-band radio with 1050Hz detection (the tone used to indicate a watch or warning). It’s also the first in the industry to incorporate a SAME processor. SAME (Specific Area Message Encoding) allows the device to listen only for a certain kind of warning or statement.

### Sparkfun's version has problems ###
I was using the Sparkfun version but it was a pain in the \*\*\*\*\*\*!!  
The new radio is from http://www.aiwindustries.com/ and I can tell you it is much easier to work with.
It has a built-in BNC connector for an antenna tuned to the Weather Band and no pesky voltage dividers on the VIO pins (come on Sparkfun :{P).
It needs a level shifter if you intend to use a 5v uC but one of those can be had from https://www.adafruit.com/.
